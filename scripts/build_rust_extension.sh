# With single-wheel architecture (post-#355), `pip install -e .` invokes
# maturin (declared in pyproject.toml's `[build-system]`) which builds the
# Rust extension and installs it into site-packages alongside the Python
# source. Earlier versions of this script symlinked the .so into the
# in-tree `legroom/` directory because the dual-package layout left the
# .so in `crates/legroom-py/python/legroom/`. That dance is no longer
# needed — maturin places the .so directly in the editable install's
# overlay and Python's import system finds it.
#
# Idempotent. Safe to run repeatedly.
